## Financial Data Analysis and Stock Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analysing real-world stock market data to identify trends, extract meaningful insights and build predictive models for short-term movements. 
The analysis was carried out using Python, with an emphasis on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), technical indicators and machine learning techniques.

This project was developed as part of my academic and personal portfolio to demonstrate practical data analysis skills within the finance domain.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess historical stock market datasets
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns
- Generate technical indicators such as SMA, EMA and RSI
- Implement and compare a manual-based SVM model with a library-based SVM model
- Evaluate model performance and document analytical findings

## Dataset
- Historical stock price data for selected companies (AAPL, NFLX, GOOG)
- Features include Open, High, Low, Close prices and Trading Volume

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Scikit-learn (Support Vector Machine)
- VS Code
- Git and GitHub

## Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of financial datasets
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visual insights
- Feature engineering using technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI)
- Training and evaluation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models
- Comparison between manual and library-based model implementations

## Key Learnings
- Practical application of data analysis techniques in finance
